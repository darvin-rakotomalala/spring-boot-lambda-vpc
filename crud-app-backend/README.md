## Spring Boot Rest CRUD API example

In this backend project, we’re gonna build a Spring Boot Rest CRUD API example with Maven that use Spring Data JPA to
interact with PostgreSQL database.

We will build a Spring Boot JPA Rest CRUD API for a Tutorial application in that:

* Each Tutorial has id, title, description, published status.
* APIs help to create, retrieve, update, delete Tutorials.
* APIs also support custom finder methods such as find by published status or by title.

These are APIs that we need to provide:

* POST ```/api/tutorials``` — create new Tutorial
* GET ```/api/tutorials``` — retrieve all Tutorials
* GET ```/api/tutorials/:id``` — retrieve a Tutorial by ```:id```
* PUT ```/api/tutorials/:id``` — update a Tutorial by ```:id```
* DELETE ```/api/tutorials/:id``` — delete a Tutorial by ```:id```
* DELETE ```/api/tutorials``` — delete all Tutorials
* GET ```/api/tutorials/published``` — find all published Tutorials
* GET ```/api/tutorials?title=[keyword]``` — find all Tutorials which title contains keyword

- We make CRUD operations & finder methods with Spring Data JPA’s JpaRepository.
- The database could be PostgreSQL or MySQL depending on the way we configure project dependency & datasource.
